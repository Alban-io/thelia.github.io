## Example 1

Check if curent administrator is allowed tu use the back-office search function :

```smarty
{loop name="top-bar-search" type="auth" context="admin" roles="ADMIN" permissions="admin.search"}
<form class="form-search" action="{url path='/admin/search'}">
... form content ...
	</form>
{/loop}
```
The context is "admin", which means that the Administrator user is used to check the authorisation.
The role is ADMIN, which mean that the current user should have the "ADMIN" role.
The permission is "admin.search", which is the identifier of the search permission.

## Example 2

Check if the customer is logged in, or not.

```smarty
{loop type="auth" name="customer_info_block" roles="CUSTOMER" context="front"}
<p>Your are logged in. <a href="{viewurl view='index' action='logoutCustomer'}">Logout</a></p>
{/loop}

{elseloop rel="customer_info_block"}
You are not logged in. <a href="{viewurl view='login'}">Login now</a> or <a href="{viewurl view='create_account'}">create your account</a>
{/elseloop}
```
