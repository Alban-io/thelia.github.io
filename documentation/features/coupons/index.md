#What about managing coupons in order for your customer to get discount ?

A coupon is

* An [effect](/documentation/features/coupon/effects.html) (ex: disount -10£ on your customer total checkout
* A [rule](/documentation/features/coupon/rules.html), whether your customer is eligible for this Coupon (ex: total cart price > 400£)

We designed this feature in order to let you build the Coupon you wish. Whether it is usual or it is vey specific to your business model.
By default numerous Coupons are available but any developer will will able to implement your demand.

Here are some unusual demands our customers already met :

* A coupon available only if you are a woman
* A coupon available only if the customer browser is not Internet Explorer
* A coupon usable by an only customer
* A Coupon giving a discount for another customer on behalf of the first customer

As you can see application field can be wide.
