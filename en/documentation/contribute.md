Thelia project is host on [GitHub](https://github.com/thelia/thelia). For contributing you just have to fork the project
and submit [Pull Request](https://help.github.com/articles/using-pull-requests) or [Issues](https://github.com/thelia/thelia)

## Coding Standard

Thelia follow [PSR-I](http://www.php-fig.org/psr/psr-1/) and [PSR-2](http://www.php-fig.org/psr/psr-2/) therefore you
must follow this rules. Don't worry, you can use some tools for doing this like the
[PHP Coding Standards Fixer](http://cs.sensiolabs.org/)

## Pull Request

[Creating a Pull request](https://help.github.com/articles/creating-a-pull-request) is the better way for submitting a
patch but there are some rules to follow. First of all, fork [Thelia](https://github.com/thelia/thelia) repo and create
a new branch, never work on the master branch, use it only for syncing with [Thelia](https://github.com/thelia/thelia) repo.

```
$ git checkout -b new-branch master
```

After finishing your modification you have to rebase your branch and push it to your repo

```
$ git remote add upstream https://github.com/thelia/thelia.git
$ git checkout master
$ git pull --ff-only upstream master
$ git checkout new-branch
$ git rebase master
$ git push origin new-branch
```

Next and last step, submit a Pull Request as indicated in the [GitHub documentation](https://help.github.com/articles/creating-a-pull-request).

## SQL scripts Modification

Form Thelia version 2.2, if you submit modifications that adds new data or change the structure of the database, please the following documentation.

SQL files should not be modified directly as they are generated by a Thelia command. Instead, you should edit the smarty templates. The first one is the file `setup/insert.sql.tpl` that is used to generate the `insert.sql` file. Others are located in `setup/update/tpl` and are used to generate all SQL update files.

This templates only differ from sql for **i18n** tables. *But we could imagine other uses with Smarty*.  
A typical application : 

```smarty
INSERT INTO  `module_i18n` (`id`, `locale`, `title`, `description`, `chapo`, `postscriptum`) VALUES
{foreach $locales as $locale}
  (@max_id+1, '{$locale}', {intl l='Navigation block' locale=$locale}, NULL,  NULL,  NULL),
  (@max_id+2, '{$locale}', {intl l='Currency block' locale=$locale}, NULL,  NULL,  NULL),
  ...
  (@max_id+12, '{$locale}', {intl l='New Products block' locale=$locale}, NULL,  NULL,  NULL),
  (@max_id+13, '{$locale}', {intl l='Products offer block' locale=$locale}, NULL,  NULL,  NULL){if ! $locale@last},{/if}

{/foreach}
;
```

- `{foreach $locales as $locale}` is used to iterate on the list of locales : en_US, fr_FR, ...
- `{intl l='Navigation block' locale=$locale}` is used to display the translation corresponding to the `l` attribute. This `intl` function 
differs from the classic one used in Thelia. If the translation does not exist, no fallbacks will be used by default. 
The text will be escaped for SQL and quotes will be placed around the input string. If the string is empty then it will be replaced by a `NULL` value. 
The attribute `in_string="1"` is used to disabled the placement of quotes around the string. The attribute use_default="1" allow you to use the `l` 
attribute as a fallback if the translation does not exist.
- don't forget to use the `{if ! $locale@last},{/if}` before the `{/foreach}` otherwise your SQL will not be valid.

Keep attention on brackets `{` or `}` that is used by smarty. You can use `{ldelim}`, `{rdelim}` or `{literal}...{/literal}` to escape non smarty code.

To translate the new string, you can use the translation page in the back office. 

I you modify templates you have to regenerate all sql files, you can use this Thelia command : `php Thelia generate:sql`

You can also limit to a specific list of locales if you use `locales` parameter : `php Thelia generate:sql --locales='en_US,fr_FR'`
