# URLs and paths

URLs in your templates should be created using the `{url}`, `{navigate}` or `{view}` Smarty functions, to ensure compatibility with all possible Thelia configuration.

> URLs in your template should always be absolute !

## {url}

This Smarty function builds an absolute URL from a route path:

    {url path="/contact"}

will gives:

    http://www.yourshop.com/contact

### `path`

The value of the path parameter is the route path you want to get as an URL. For example, to get the URL of the `/account/password` route, use :

    <a href="{url path="/account/password"}">{intl l='Change your password'}</a>

### `file`

The value of the `file` parameter is the absolute path (from /web) of a real file, that will be served by your web server, and not processed by Thelia.

For example, if you put a `guide.pdf` file in the `/web` directory, the URL of this file is :

    {url file="/guide.pdf"}

which gives :

    http://www.yourshop.com/guide.pdf

### `noamp`

Setting `noamp=1` will escape all `&` as `&amp;` that may be present in the generated URL.

### Adding custom parameters to the generated URL

You may add as many parameters as you want to the generated URL, by adding them as `{url}` parameters :

    {url path="/contact" myvar="1" myothervar="2"}

will gives :

    http://www.yourshop.com/contact?myvar=1&myothervar=2


## `{viewurl}`

This function generates the absolute URL to a front office view (e.g. an HTML file in the current template). If we have for example a `legal.html` file in a front-office template, the way to get the URL to display this view is:

    <a href="{viewurl view="legal"}">{intl l="Legal"}</a>

which gives :

    <a href="http://www.yourshop.com/?view=legal">{intl l="Legal"}</a>

You may also add as many parameters as you want to the generated URL, by adding them as `{viewurl}` parameters :

    {viewurl view="legal" myvar="1" myothervar="2"}

will gives :

    http://www.yourshop.com/?view=legal&myvar=1&myothervar=2

## `{admin_viewurl}`

`{admin_viewurl}` performs the same URL generation as `{viewurl}`, but operates on back office templates only.

Please refer to `{viewurl}` for usage and details.

## {navigate}

The `{navigate}`function is a convenient way to generate URLs pointing to common locations. This function has only one parameter, `to`, which may take one of the following values:

- `current`: this is the absolute URL of the current page
- `previous` : this is the absolute URL of the previous page
- `index` : this is the absolute URL of the shop home page

Example:

- return to the shop home page : `<a href="{navigate to='index'}">{intl l="Back to home"}</a>`
- go back to the previous page : `<a href="{navigate to='previous'}">{intl l="Back to home"}</a>`
- reload the current page : `<a href="{navigate to='current'}">{intl l="Reload !"}</a>`

You can't add custom parameters to the URL generated by `{navigate}`. To do so, use is along with the `{url}` function :

    {url path={navigate to="current"} limit="4"}

This way the limit=4 parameter is added to the URL : `http://www.myshop.com/current-page-url.html?limit=4`
